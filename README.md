# Toxicity Comment Classification

A machine learning project to classify toxic comments using deep learning and NLP techniques.

This repository follows a clean, production-style structure with notebooks for experimentation and modular Python scripts for core logic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- NLP (Text Vectorization, Embeddings)

---

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Experiments and exploration are done in `notebooks/`
2. Reusable logic is moved to `src/`
3. Trained models are saved in `models/`
4. Datasets are kept locally or loaded from external sources

---

## 📌 Current Status

- Project structure initialized
- Notebook and directories set up
- Implementation will be added incrementally

---

## 📄 Notes

- Large datasets are not pushed to GitHub
- Models may be versioned selectively
- This repository is actively being developed
